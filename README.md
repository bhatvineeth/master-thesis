Rapid growth in the field of Cloud Computing has led to the development of various cloud technologies like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform- as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the need for moving every- thing to the cloud is ever-growing. Utilizing the advancement in Cloud Com- puting, such services are extended to provide remote desktops delivered as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) which uses remote desktop connection (RDC) to provide the desktop to users via a web browser. Looking into such applications this thesis focuses on devel- oping a concept of DaaS using modern available open-source technologies that uses RDC to provide a remote desktop over the web browser and also proposes a way of improving a similar open-source application called the Oneye, formerly known as eyeOS. Design, architecture, implementation, test- ing and comparison of such applications will give a good understanding of what DaaS is and how one can develop this to provide the market standard services desired from such applications.
